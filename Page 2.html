            <h3>Why adoption?</h3>
            <p>
                Adoption is so much more than you putting a roof over your pet's head it means giving them an opportunity, or even a second one, to live right, feeling loved and protected by their human friends. 
                Just picture the wag of a tail, or hear the purring as an animal abandoned long ago settles onto their new bed or even your sofa, but always under a safe roof to be. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Making the choice of adoption it is is a powerful act of compassion that saves and alters lives. 
                It is one of the biggest acts of kindness we are capable of doing, and after it you get a furry and unconditional loyal friend for all lifetime. 
                One adoption at a time, we can impact change.
            </p>
            <h3> Success Stories </h3>
            <p> 
                Every pet that walks in our door has history, more often that what we would like it is not a bright and happy one. However, those stories, if you choose to adopt can change beautifully with them.

            <h4>Meet Pupi:</h4>
            <p> 
                 Her mother ran away very scared from her old house during a big and loud holiday party. 
                After days and nights of fear and hungry a loving family found her not knowing she was all that time pregnant with seven babies. 
                Luckily the family gave away all the puppies in responsible adoptions, Pupi was the last one and there was no family who could take her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually, because of that wait she created a bond with her mom none could break, not even the foster family who decided after a few days that they would adopt Pupi as well. 
                Now they have been living together as mother and daughter for more than 9 years thanks to that loving family.

            <h4>Meet Muffi:</h4>
            <p> 
                He was a stray dog in the hot and dangerous streets of Cuba. 
                Going through so much pain, fear and abuse, he got very sick by the point of almost dying. 
                But then a lovely girl found him and decided to tak him home with her. 
                She was hopeful but without the access to the right medicines or good veterinaries cares. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Muffi struggled for his life for many weeks, and no progress was seen, but when everyone told her to let him go, she kept trying. 
                So when she found an opportunity to live abroad, she knew she needed to bring him also. 
                Now, a few treatments and years latter Muffito could not be healthier and happier living in The Netherlands thanks to that girl who never gave up on him.
