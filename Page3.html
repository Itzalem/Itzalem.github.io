                Doing something for these pets does not always comes in the same ways. From small actions to big 
                gestures, the options are several to let them know you are here for them.

        <h3>Volunteer</h3>
        <p>
            Not adopting does not mean your hands are tied in the matter. Volunteering is an option too, in any 
            of its forms. You can work as an adoption coordinator, as an occasional driver or doing food 
            distribution. Of course, if you want to be really close to the animals there are roles like foster 
            parents, in-shelters volunteers or even just going for a walk with the dogs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Trust us, we can make a huge difference transforming these animals’ lives with just a tiny bit of your 
            help. Your support means the world to these furry friends, giving them a second chance and a brighter 
            future. Imagine what it could be done with more often donations, all the waggy tales you will be 
            contributing to save.

            <h3>Donate</h3>
            <p>
                Making a donation it’s one of the most common ways to help, resulting easy, fast and very rewarding. 
                If only a few people made a small donation of 5 or 10 euros, the rescued pets can have access to more 
                food, better accommodation, veterinary attention, or even the opportunity to take in more animals in 
                those shelters with limited resources.

            <h3>Buy goods</h3>
            <p>
            If you want to take it beyond donation, make it more personal and thoughtful, buying could be your way to help. 
            Any presents like food, toys, medication, accessories, collars, everything you can think of, might help those pets. 
            Every organization would be delighted and really grateful welcoming any gift you could send.

            <h3>More help in different forms</h3>
            <p>
            Plus, you will get to know you are directly improving the lives of these adorable creatures. So, next time you are out 
            shopping or browsing online, consider tossing an extra treat or toy for a shelter pet. Adding that little something to 
            your cart can make their day. If you have a shelter near home don’t forget to check their website, as they often have wish 
            lists to guide your purchase and make it easer for you.
